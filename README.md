# Capstone Project Evaluation Rubric

This rubric outlines the grading criteria for the final capstone project. Each aspect of the project is evaluated on a scale from 0 to 5, where higher scores indicate better performance. The project will be assessed on the quality of its documentation, organization, presentation, functionality, and deployment.

This rubric represents **70% of the total evaluation**, while the remaining **30% will be determined by the Evaluation Committee**.

To successfully pass this bootcamp, each participant must achieve at least **70% of the total score**.
